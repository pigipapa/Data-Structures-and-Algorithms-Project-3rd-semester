The main idea of the project is to simulate the movie "A Νight in the Μuseum", but this time with Theseus and Minotaur as protagonists. In our version, Theseus is aiming to collect all the supplies placed into the labyrinth while avoiding being caught by the Minotaur. 

## Further info on the project
The walls of the labyrinth and the supplies are placed randomly in the maze. Minotaur's initial position is the center of the labyrinth, while Theseus' is the labyrinth's entrance. The user has the option to select the type of the players which varies from random Player (zero intelligence) to Heuristic Player (semi-clever player) and finally MinMax Player, the smartest of all making choices based on the MiniMax algorithm.
